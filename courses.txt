CS 125|Intro to Computer Science|Basic concepts in computing and fundamental techniques for solving computational problems. Intended as a first course for computer science majors and others with a deep interest in computing.|4
CS 173|Discrete Structures|Discrete mathematical structures frequently encountered in the study of Computer Science. Sets, propositions, Boolean algebra, induction, recursion, relations, functions, and graphs.|3
CS 225|Data Structures|Data abstractions: elementary data structures (lists, stacks, queues, and trees) and their implementation using an object-oriented programming language. Solutions to a variety of computational problems such as search on graphs and trees. Elementary analysis of algorithms.|4
CS 233|Computer Architecture|Fundamentals of computer architecture: digital logic design, working up from the logic gate level to understand the function of a simple computer; machine-level programming to understand implementation of high-level languages; performance models of modern computer architectures to enable performance optimization of software; hardware primitives for parallelism and security.|4
CS 241|System Programming|Basics of system programming, including POSIX processes, process control, inter-process communication, synchronization, signals, simple memory management, file I/O and directories, shell programming, socket network programming, RPC programming in distributed systems, basic security mechanisms, and standard tools for systems programming such as debugging tools.|4
MATH 241|Calculus III|Third course in calculus and analytic geometry including vector analysis: Euclidean space, partial differentiation, multiple integrals, line integrals and surface integrals, the integral theorems of vector calculus.|4
MATH 415|Applied Linear Algebra|Introductory course emphasizing techniques of linear algebra with applications to engineering; topics include matrix operations, determinants, linear equations, vector spaces, linear transformations, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors, inner products and norms, orthogonality, equilibrium, and linear dynamical systems.|3
